# Client_Server_Program
This project demonstrates how two programs (client and server) communicate with each other over a TCP/IP network using sockets in the C language. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) provides reliable, connection-oriented communication, ensuring that data sent by one side is received correctly by the other.
